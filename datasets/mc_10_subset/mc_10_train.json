The stones are so named, despite having been placed in many different years, because of a 1767 directive of the Province of Massachusetts Bay that such stones be placed along major roadways. The state highway department was directed in 1960 to undertake their preservation. Many of them underwent a major restoration in 2018.The first stone was erected by Paul Dudley, one of the prominent citizens of early 18th century Massachusetts, in Roxbury, which was at the time a separate community. Roxbury was located at the end of the Boston Neck, a narrow isthmus separating the mainland from the Shawmut Peninsula, where Boston was located. Travelers going by land from Boston to other areas had to travel over the neck and through Roxbury to reach their destinations.

Frederick Law Olmsted (1822\u20131903) is recognized as the founder of American landscape architecture and the nation's foremost parkmaker of the 19th century.  In 1883, Olmsted moved his home to suburban Boston and established \"Fairsted\", the world's first full-scale professional office for the practice of landscape design. Over the course of the next century, his sons and successors expanded and perpetuated Olmsted's design ideals, philosophy, and influence.\nThe site is located at 99 Warren Street, in the Green Hill section of Brookline.  Olmsted bought the Clark homestead, an 1810 Federal farmhouse, in 1883, to be near his frequent collaborator, H. H. Richardson, whose home and office were nearby.  Olmsted and his son John Charles renovated the house, landscaped the property, and relocated the barn closer to the house, and in 1903 added the office wing to the northwest of the main house.  Members of the Olmsted family occupied the main house until 1936, when Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. moved to Elkton, Maryland, renting the house to tenants.  The offices of the Olmsted Brothers firm continued to be in the wing during this time, although business also declined.  Members of the firm reoccupied the house in the 1960s, making substantial alterations to the original landscaping of the property.  The property was acquired by the National Park Service in 1980.  The grounds have been restored to a c. 1930 appearance, restoring much of Olmsted's landscaping.Park resources include the restored \"Fairsted\" historic landscape, and the design office (which remains virtually unchanged from the days when the Olmsted firm's activity was at its height.) Housed within the office complex are nearly 1,000,000 original design records detailing work on many of America's most treasured landscapes, including the grounds of the U. S. Capitol and White House; Great Smoky Mountains and Acadia National Parks; Yosemite Valley; New York's Central Park; and whole park systems in cities such as Buffalo, Seattle, Boston, Louisville and Montreal.

The copper statue, a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States, was designed by French sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886.\nThe statue is a figure of Libertas, a robed Roman liberty goddess. She holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed JULY IV MDCCLXXVI (July 4, 1776 in Roman numerals), the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. A broken shackle and chain lie at her feet as she walks forward, commemorating the recent national abolition of slavery. After its dedication, the statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States, seen as a symbol of welcome to immigrants arriving by sea.\nBartholdi was inspired by a French law professor and politician, \u00c9douard Ren\u00e9 de Laboulaye, who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and U.S. peoples. The Franco-Prussian War delayed progress until 1875, when Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the U.S. provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.\nThe torch-bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882. Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York World, started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar (equivalent to $29 in 2020). The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.\nThe statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War; since 1933 it has been maintained by the National Park Service as part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument, and is a major tourist attraction. Public access to the balcony around the torch has been barred since 1916.", "class": 74, "hf_iids": [1109, 1457, 2980, 4175, 1104, 8146, 117, 3184, 1227, 1112, 8146, 13832, 4568, 4777, 1103, 1291, 113, 1497, 131, 2001, 5255, 7488, 2744, 255, 1665, 20293, 2861, 5837, 19863, 2007, 114, 117, 1110, 170, 1884, 20831, 1348, 15242, 23974, 7115, 1113, 8146, 2054, 1107, 1203, 1365, 7835, 1439, 1203, 1365, 1392, 117, 1107, 1103, 1244, 1311]}, "Q4132676": {"coord": "Point(-122.366666666 37.908611111)", "enlink": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosie_the_Riveter_World_War_II_Home_Front_National_Historical_Park", "images": ["http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Liberty%20Ship%20scaler%20HD-SN-99-02466.JPG"], "classes": ["National Historical Park", "park"], "en": "Rosie the Riveter World War II Home Front National Historical Park is a United States national historical park located in Richmond, California, near San Francisco.
